# Actually I want to know the performance differences. Thhe way I understand it is, using self would be less performatic since it would need the copy attribute, which would copy the whole structure instead of changing only a field. Is it correct?

But, does using \&mut self and \&self deviates from the functional programming paradigm? Since it lets the data be mutable, it rises more risks to the data being not consistent during the lifetime of the program?

Your understanding is mostly correct, and the trade-offs between `self`, `&mut self`, and `&self` in Rust involve both performance and design paradigms, including functional programming considerations.

## Performance Differences

- **Using `self` (by value)** means the method takes ownership of the entire struct. If the struct implements `Copy`, it will be copied entirely when passed by value. For large structs (like your `MapData` with a 2D array), this can be expensive due to the full data copy. If it does not implement `Copy`, ownership is moved without copying, but the original instance is consumed and cannot be used afterward. So:
    - If `Copy` is implemented, yes, passing `self` copies the whole structure, which can be costly.
    - If not `Copy`, ownership moves without copying, but the original is no longer usable.
- **Using `&mut self` or `&self`** passes a reference (mutable or immutable), which is a small pointer-sized value, so no copying of the entire struct occurs. This is generally more performant for large structs because you avoid copying the whole data.

Therefore, **using `&mut self` or `&self` is usually more efficient than passing `self` by value for large structs**[^1][^2].

## Mutability and Functional Programming Paradigm

- **`&mut self` allows mutation of the instance in place**, which means the data can change during the program's lifetime. This is imperative style and can introduce risks such as data inconsistency if not carefully managed.
- **`&self` is immutable borrowing**, which aligns better with functional programming principles where data is not mutated but rather transformed.
- **Using `self` by value and returning a new instance** fits the functional programming paradigm better because you consume the old instance and produce a new one, avoiding in-place mutation and side effects[^1][^2].

## Summary of Your Questions

| Question | Answer |
| :-- | :-- |
| Is using `self` less performant because it copies the whole struct? | Yes, if the struct implements `Copy`, it copies the entire data, which can be expensive. If not `Copy`, ownership moves without copying but consumes the instance. |
| Does using `&mut self` and `&self` deviate from functional programming? | Yes, `&mut self` allows mutation and side effects, which is less functional. `&self` is immutable and more functional. Using `self` and returning a new instance is more functional. |
| Are there risks with mutable data? | Yes, mutable data can lead to inconsistent state if not carefully managed. Rust's borrow checker mitigates many risks by enforcing exclusive mutable access. |

## Practical Advice

- Prefer **`&self`** for read-only methods.
- Prefer **`&mut self`** for in-place mutation when performance matters and you want to avoid copying.
- Use **`self` by value** when you want to consume and transform the instance, e.g., builder patterns or immutable transformations.
- Avoid implementing `Copy` on large structs to prevent accidental expensive copies.
- Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules help manage mutation risks better than many other languages.

## References from Search Results

- Reddit discussion: prefer `&self` unless mutation is needed, and `self` when consuming the instance is desired. Copying large structs with `self` can be costly[^1].
- Stack Overflow: `self` consumes the instance, `&mut self` allows mutation, `&self` is for reading only. Prefer the most restrictive form that fits your use case[^2].
- Rust Users Forum: using `self` can be natural for transformations but may have performance drawbacks depending on compiler optimizations[^5].

If you want a more functional style, consider designing your methods to take `self` and return a new instance, but be aware of the potential copying cost for large data. For performance-critical mutable updates, `&mut self` is idiomatic and efficient in Rust, with safety guaranteed by the borrow checker.
