# DSquareMapper

## OBS: This project is nowhere near finished! It may never be really finished, actually

The idea is to make a app with user interface to manually map a... map, like what Etrian Oddysey has. It's also, specially, a excuse for me to try to learn rust and other Programming Paradigms and architectures, like Elm and declarative? functional? programming. Something in that line.

Update: 20/06/2025
- UI included using macroquad. Now the map can be updated by mouse input instead of arguments in termina;
- Changed the MapData to have more useful methods for manipulating its own attributes.

Update: 21/06/2025
- Add the reset button, so it's easier to clear the current map.
