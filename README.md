# DSquareMapper

## OBS: This project is nowhere near finished!

The idea is to make a app with user interface to manually map a... map, like what Etrian Oddysey has. It's also, specially, a excuse for me to try to learn rust and other Programming Paradigms.

So far, it's only possible to map basic floor data through the terminal. It should stay like this for a while until I'm satisfied with the logical structure and understand better the nuances of separating logic from models and views, based on the Elm architecture. Hopefully this will help to design architectures for games as well.
